* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the sidebar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, email us at [pp4rs@econ.uzh.ch]() so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.
* Where necessary, we have provided instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux machines.
